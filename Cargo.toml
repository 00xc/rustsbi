# Run RustSBI on machine mode
# This feature enables to use RISC-V primitives on current machine mode environment
# If you are developing a cross-architecture virtual machine, consider disabling this feature
# to customize environment variables for RISC-V architecture like mvendorid, mimpid, etc.
machine = ["dep:riscv"]
# Build RustSBI singleton
# This would enable `init_*` functions. It will take extra place on bss or data region
# to take care of singleton reference locks.
# Disable this feature to use instance based RustSBI environment.
